Hello, I'm Jonathan Thomas. I'm using github to show proof of all the code I plan to write in the future. I'm interested in cybersecurity and as such I'll be writing projects in Python, C/C++, Java, MYSQL, PHP, Perl and whatever else I can find. I hope to learn a lot here and look forward to presenting my fail
 In here I'll be posting all the different ways to write hello world in the langauges that I know....k bye!
